# Results

This folder contains a subsets of results on various instances from the test data. 

In the report four classes are introduced, namely, **Mutants**, **Formose**, **PPP**, and **Reaxys**. The test instances for all classes except for the instances from **Reaxys** is present in the **../test/instances/** folder. 

The instances named with **Aldol addition** and **Keto-enol isomerization** is from the **Formose** class. 

The instances named with **Aldolase**, **Aldose-Ketose**, **Phophohydrolase**, and **Transaldolase** is from **PPP**.

The instances from **Mutants** and **Reaxys** are clearly named as such. 

The instances are executed with various parameters. The desired effect here is to present how the results are visualised and give examples of how the alignments appear.
